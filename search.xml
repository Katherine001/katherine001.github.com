    <title>重启博客</title>
    <url>/2021/01/21/hello-world/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>当大家看见这篇文章，时隔我上一个博客关闭已接近两年。</p>
<p>这次，我打算重新开启我个人博客的记录。</p>
<p>我给我的博客取名“Alisa·外刊学习”，自然也就意味着这个博客的内容以<strong>分享我外刊学习</strong>为主，包括<strong>学习笔记、写作句型总结、学习心得</strong>，同时我的博客也会有关于我个人生活心得，其他内容的学习记录，但这不会占据我的博客太多位置。</p>
<p>关于学习外刊，有很多途径。英语基础较高的人可以直接订阅原版外刊杂志，比如经济学人，科学美国人等；基础一般或偏低的可以选择跟老师或者公众号学习，这里推荐丁晓钟老师的外刊课，他的授课注重<strong>逻辑、指代、替换、搭配</strong>等全方位语言基本功提升，他的课可以在cctalk和考虫平台上学习到，这边强烈推荐他的<strong>看世界</strong>课程。当然，其他的途径比如微信公众号经济学人双语精读中的Soren老师、在下林柏虎等也都是不错的老师。</p>
<p>当今世界，全球新冠疫情肆虐。在中华民族的的土地上，我们享受着国家和政府严控新冠带来的美好生活。于此，我们更应努力提升自己，为祖国的未来添砖加瓦。使用博客，记录自己成长的点点滴滴，拥抱美好而充实的生活！</p>
